            <p>We were introduced to the tutors, Haowei, Shiv and Jamie, during our first week of web design course. In the class, we were taught how the course has evolved through the years, shifting from predominantly coding-based in 2020 to more design-focused. We revised the assignments throughout the course, starting with Assignment 1. There were also exemplars for each assignment, which gave a clear overview of the course and stages throughout. We were encouraged to be informed about Webflow during the tutorial and watched a brief introduction course. </p>
            <p>We participated in a class icebreaker where we created a decorative note on a shared Miro board:</p>

            <p>Going forward, I hope to develop my website and coding skills and connect with the students, as I tend to find online courses slightly isolating. I do not have any coding experience, so it’s important to have a social group to assist each other’s learning. I hope by having friends within this class I will enrich my understanding further. This class was a great introduction to the paper and allowed me to familiarise myself with the tutors, students and course structure.</p>
