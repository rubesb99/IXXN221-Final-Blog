            <h3>17th July - 21st July</h3>
            <p>This week, we delved into Assignment 1, a research report to help us understand our users and build their best experience. The tutorial taught us the importance of understanding the users before designing. When designing a service, the users should dictate our designs, their needs, wants, personalities and abilities. </p>
            <p>As designers, we can understand users by creating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed user personas: allowing designers to gain deep insight into users.</li>
                <li>Determining goals for your web product: what is the purpose and goal?</li>
                <li>Planning user journeys: discussing the emotions and pains of a user while interacting with our product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After refining our fictional user and addressing their goals, we must define a specific problem our user faces and design a website to resolve this issue best. </p>
            <p>This week, we were also taught about the history of website design from 1990-1998. I was interested to learn the first website browser was created for instant information-sharing between universities across the globe. I was surprised that CSS1 only came into play in 1996. It’s unbelievable to see how progressive website design has been. As a developing UX designer, I found it fascinating how rapidly website design took off; it’s easy to forget the web was only created over 30 years ago. We were also introduced to simple HTML code. Coding is an area I find pretty daunting, but I hope to gain confidence throughout this course.</p>
