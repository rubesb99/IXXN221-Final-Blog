            <p>Autex Acoustics was our site of the week. I immediately noticed the use of parallax, displacing the background and foreground. I found this very subtle yet impactful and tasteful. While scrolling, there were many animations which the designer did to direct users' attention. This website was my favourite yet, and I hope to acquire the coding skills required to produce such a service someday. I have a while to go, but I am pleased with my progress so far!</p>
            <p>The tutorial discussed the purpose of responsive design techniques. Fluid grids, flexible images and media queries are all responsive design concepts to help build an impactful user experience. We were encouraged to test our website by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device emulation (looking at different screen sizes)</li>
                <li>Cross-browser testing (checking our design compatibility with multiple browsers)</li>
                <li>Usability testing (involves real users to gather user experience feedback)</li>
            </ul>
			<p>Emphasis was made on effective file organisation to maximise productivity, collaboration and maintenance. We were given suggestions for structuring folders, creating naming conventions, and introducing asset management practices. We also touched on the importance of image formats, specifically JPEG, balancing image quality with file size. I also noted how to accurately write alt for text or images without using unnecessary words such as "picture". These habits are crucial to develop while young to become an efficient and organised web designer.</p>
