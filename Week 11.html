            <p>In the eleventh week, there were no tutorials as we spent class time presenting Assignment 2.2. I was quite nervous because I wish I had added more interactive elements after seeing other peer submissions. If I continue developing my CMS, I would love to have multiple shots of each artwork and have the image change when the mouse hovers. I also would utilise white space more. Since the paintings are busy visually, white space would complement nicely.</p>
            <p>During this week, I also began looking at HTML files for inspiration for Assignment 3. Most of the templates I found were too advanced to build from scratch, but it was insightful to see layout options. I liked the look of having a home page and an individual HMTL for each weekly blog. My coding skills have developed throughout the semester; however, I am still learning and have never built a website in HTML from scratch. I am excited and nervous about completing this final assignment!</p>
