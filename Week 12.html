            <p>I am pleased with my progress through this course. I was often out of my comfort zone and accomplished new skills. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy HTML coding and, as a result, would love the opportunity to learn different coding languages in the future. A particular challenge I faced was separating the style code into a separate CSS file. It turns out the file location of the CSS was incorrect while I spent an awful amount of time focused on finding fault in my coding, a simple fix made not so simple.</p>
            <p>Assignment 1 was precious because I underestimated how detailed UX designers comprehend their users. I now know to dedicate time at the beginning of any UX project to using tools like user personas, Venn diagrams, user flows, and user journey maps to understand my users. By doing this, my process will likely be faster, and the final product will undoubtedly be designed accurately to the users' needs and wants.</p>
			<p>Throughout this paper, I used my artwork for my projects. As a result, I have a website that contains all my work. I would love to put my own label on it and use it in my portfolio after university. After this course, I am much more critical about web design on a daily basis, and this is developing my design eye to produce better work next year!</p>
