            <p>The site of the week was Courier. I immediately noticed the grid, which remained consistent throughout the whole main page, which I found visually appealing. The website captures attention using large images with a container for a heading and occasional short paragraphs. This news outlet does a great job of visually communicating its articles; I found it an excellent method for capturing attention. </p>
            <p>We reviewed the submission requirements for Assignment 2.2, which is due the following week. The tutorial delved into the content overview to assist us with the weekly blogs and a blog demo. We were shown Shiv's blog. I was impressed with the use of gridding, images and colour on the home page. His website had interactive elements; it was great to see an example of what we are expected to produce ourselves. We touched on different blog styles to help inspire our final assignment. This tutorial was brief as we all had work to get stuck into and used this time to receive feedback in breakout rooms. </p>
            <p>So far, I am pleased with my progress in Assignment 2.2. I am familiar with EditorX and have created a functional website for my users. However, I have struggled to fit the grid for various screen sizes. Once I watched the pre-recorded tutorial running through EditorX, my frustrations were cleared up. This was extremely helpful as it clarified my questions before finalising Assignment 2.2. This tutorial helped clear up these frustrations and improved my final result. We were also taught how to publish our site correctly.</p>
