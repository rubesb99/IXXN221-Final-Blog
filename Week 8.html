            <p>Digital Eclipse was our site of the week, a website that interactively documents the origins of the video game industry. There was clear gridding, which shifted from thirds to halves, displaying the information effectively. Video game posters are often busy and crowded, but Digital Eclipse did an excellent job of using white space to emphasise the colourful images. I did wonder why the font was so large when I scrolled further; I would have the pictures accompany the text to maintain the users' attention. Digital Eclipse shows how effective a simple layout can be.</p>
            <p>This week, we were introduced to Assignment 2.2. Since I do not feel comfortable enough with HTML to do my website the justice it deserves, I decided to go with the CMS (content management systems) route. I have had previous semesters developing my CMS skills. Therefore, I will code my weekly blogs in Assignment 3. CMS is crucial to the web design industry as it enables designers to update websites efficiently. Although I have experience with Webflow, I am eager to expand my skill set and look into EditorX, which is entirely new to me. </p>
            <p>In the pre-recorded tutorial, we were taught how to grid in HTML. In this video, I learned how to use CSS to grid headers, navigation bars, sections and a footer. Different colours were incorporated into each area in the CSS. The tutor used grid templates on Figma to assist with the spacing. In doing so, the website is coded for various screen sizes. Coding for different screen sizes is crucial for a UX designer to consider to create an inclusive space for their users.</p>
