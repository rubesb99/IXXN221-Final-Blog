            <p>Our site of the week was Surfe, a website designed to reduce the manual workload for the users. This website had a clear walkthrough of what users can expect from their service. I knew this was effective when I considered looking further into it for personal use! From a design perspective, this is a clear and impactful way to communicate with users. Hence, they know exactly what to expect, creating a transparent and trustworthy interaction between the user and the company.</p>
            <p>In this class, we were reminded of the structure we are to hand in Assignment 1 the following week. After that, we were given extra time for project support. At this time, I checked if our user was supposed to be a fictional character from media and television, as seeing Rachel Green in the exemplar puzzled me. This is, of course, different from the case, and my user understanding was coming along nicely. I had the character persona complete and was now developing the other techniques like the Venn diagram and user journey map. As a designer, I am sure these skills would allow a proper understanding of a user's wants and needs, creating impactful designs.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, we learned about grid formatting and flex boxes in HTML. Grid formatting helps designers as it keeps the sizes of elements proportionate and responsive for all screen sizes, increasing user experience. Grid systems keep aspects of a website consistently structured. Additionally, since it breaks the website into groups, it is much easier to revisit and improve. Grid systems are an excellent way to manage a website's aesthetic and practical development. I found it insightful when we broke the websites into blocks as I started to visualise the different structures of websites I saw, even outside of class time.</p>
			<p>So far, my coding skills are developing steadily. I am gaining confidence in other papers and look forward to challenging myself in this course. I enjoy working in HTML, the language is easy to read and I can usually input the changes I would like. However, I am finding CSS much more confusing but it is still early days.</p>
